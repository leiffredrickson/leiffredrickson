### Thanks for visiting!

You can read about the basic purpose of this site [here](/about/), and I give an overview of my research [here](/projects/).

In case you'd like a more personal introduction: I'm from Missoula, Montana. My parents were public school teachers. I attended Hellgate Highschool (really), where I was really into punk rock.

After going to Vassar College for undergrad, I returned to Montana where I worked in a variety of jobs. I was a [hooker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RhC1tESkRU), and I had a part-time horseshoeing business. I worked for nine seasons in Bob Marshall Wilderness. In that job, we occasionally had to blow up a horse that died in the backcountry so that grizzlies would not be attracted to it. Turns out a lot of labor goes into making wilderness areas work.

Long time plant nerd, hunter, and Bad Brains lover. I'll stop there -- all of this is just to say that, while I love academics, it's just part of my life, and not the most important.
