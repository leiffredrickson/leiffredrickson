# Dissertation  

**&quot;The Age of Lead: Metropolitan Change, Environmental Health and Inner City Underdevelopment&quot;** (PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, 2017)
  <blockquote>
  How the suburbs poisoned the inner city with lead.
  <details><summary style="color:#A8A8A8">read more...</summary>
  <br>
  <p>“The Age of Lead” examines the relationship between metropolitan development and lead poisoning in Baltimore from the late-nineteenth century to the late-twentieth century. In particular, I trace how concerns about environmental health in the city fostered the desire for suburban living, but how suburbanization deepened and even caused disparities in lead hazards between the suburbs and the inner city.</p>
  <p>More broadly, the dissertation explores how people made decisions about the costs and benefits of metropolitan development and technological change. It is about who had the power to make or influence these decisions and who benefited from those decisions and who was hurt by them. It is also about knowledge: what people knew about environmental disparities, what they did not know, and how and why they came to have knowledge or ignorance of issues.</p>

**&quot;Paving the Way for Trump: Past Presidential Assaults on Environmental Health Protection,&quot;**  _American Journal of Public Health_, (forthcoming). By Leif Fredrickson, Christopher Sellers, Phil Brown, Jennifer Liss Ohayon, Nicholas Shapiro, Marianne Sullivan, Chris Amoss, Stephen Bocking, Vanessa De La Rosa, Lindsey Dillon, Jill Harrison, Sara Johns, Katherine Kulik, Rebecca Lave, Emily Marquez, Michelle Murphy, Liza Piper, Lauren Richter, Sara Wylie, the [Environmental Data & Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/about/)

  <blockquote>

  The Trump administration's assault on environmental health protection is in some ways unparalleled, but it is not without some historical precedents. In particular, the current administration has combined strategies for undermining environmental health from the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations. The current political context is, however, different in ways that are deeply concerning, but in some cases also offer some reasons for hope.

  <details><summary style="color:#A8A8A8">read more...</summary>
  <br>

    The Trump administration has undertaken an assault on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an agency critical to environmental health. This assault has precedents in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.  The early Reagan administration (1981-1983) launched an overt attack on the EPA, combining deregulation with budget and staff cuts, while the George W. Bush administration (2001-2008) adopted a subtler approach, undermining science-based policy. The current administration combines both these strategies. It also operates in a political context more favorable to the new administration’s designs on this agency. The Republican Party has shifted to the right, and now controls the executive and both chambers of Congress. Wealthy donors, think tanks, and fossil fuel and chemical industries have become more influential in pushing deregulation. Among the public, political polarization has increased, the environment has become a partisan issue, and large sections of the public distrust science and the mainstream media. For these reasons, the effects of today’s ongoing regulatory delays, rollbacks, and staff cuts may well surpass those of the administrations of Reagan and George W. Bush, whose impacts on environmental health were considerable.

  How the city of Baltimore and the Department of Defense tried to change the environment of inner city youth in order to avert urban civil disturbances after the 1968 uprising in Baltimore.

  <details><summary style="color:#A8A8A8">read more...</summary>
  <br>

  This chapter focuses on programs put in place after the 1968 uprising in Baltimore that were related to the inner city environment. Some of these programs were about cleaning up that environment and providing better recreation. Others were about taking children out of the inner city to experience a better environment. Camp Concern, which brought children to a Navy Base for the summer, was an example of the latter. It was the brainchild of black community leaders, but was also promoted by the Department of Defense as part of a larger program of domestic pacification. There were deep tensions in these and otehr programs between the rationale of providing quality environments for social justice and the rationale of providing these programs for social control.

  In the 1990s, the Ford Motor Company pursued electric vehicle technology and testing as a way to establish itself as an authority on the technology so that it could fight against California's Zero Emission Vehicle policy that required automobile companies to produce and sell electric vehicles.

  <br>

  Natural research managers, flummoxed by their inability to find a “techno-fix” – a cheap, simple solution to a complex issue – to the problem of fish productivity, discovered a “bio-fix” in a small, wild shrimp that they believed could yield record-breaking trout and salmon for sportfishers. Like techno-fixes, however, this fix had unintended – though not unforeseeable – consequences. In many cases, it completely destroyed the fisheries it was intended to bolster.

  <blockquote>
  How environmentalists came to embrace picloram, a pesticide that had once been the foremost candidate for destroying the earth.

  <details><summary style="color:#A8A8A8">read more...</summary>
  <br>

  This article is a history of picloram, one of the most powerful defoliants used during the Vietnam War, and its relationship to environmentalism. During the war, picloram became a symbol of “ecocide” – the worst thing that could happen to the environment. But as environmentalists became concerned about invasive plants, they held their noses and embraced it as a technology that could wipe out unwanted plants and restore the “natural” environment. The change in thinking about this pesticide, I argue, revealed latent fault lines in the environmental movement over ecological versus human health and short-term versus long-term problems.

## Mapping, Data Visualization and Digital Humanities

**American Panorama**

From 2015 to 2016, I held a fellowship from the Mellon Foundation to help the University of Richmond's Digital Scholarship Lab produce ideas for the online digital atlas, [American Panorama](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama). With fellow Brent Cebul, I worked on conceptualizing and finding data for maps of urban renewal, public housing and highway building. These maps are still forthcoming. The extant American Panorama maps are amazing and award-winning.

**American Yawp**     
I authored environmental history sections for three chapters of the _American Yawp_, an online, open-source, and subsequently award-winning, U.S. history textbook.
* Chapter 27 - [The Sixties](http://www.americanyawp.com/text/27-the-sixties/)
* Chapter 29 - [The Triumph of the Right](http://www.americanyawp.com/text/29-the-triumph-of-the-right/)
* Chapter 30 - [The Recent Past](http://www.americanyawp.com/text/30-the-recent-past/)

**People of the Founding Era**    
I directed the construction of a geographic database for [People of the Founding Era](http://pfe.rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/), a digital humanities project run by the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities about the social world in the United States in the decades surrounding the American Revolution.

## Professional

**Environmental Data and Governance Initiative**

Since May, 2017 I have been involved with the [EDGI](https://envirodatagov.org/about/), a cross-disciplinary group of volunteers tracking and analyzing threats to federal environmental policies and programs, and the scientific research and data that underpin those policies and programs. I work with the Capacity & Governance Working Group. I have contributed to a report on environmental justice under the Trump administration -- ["Pursuing a Toxic Agenda"](https://envirodatagov.org/publication/pursuing-toxic-agenda/) -- and am the lead author on an article that compares the current administration's assault on environmental health protections to the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations.
