### Thanks for visiting!

You can read about the basic purpose of this site [here](/about/), and I give an overview of my research [here](/projects/).

In case you'd like a more personal introduction:

I'm from Missoula, Montana. My parents were public school teachers.

I attended Hellgate High School (really), where I was into punk rock, soccer and tennis.

I studied cognitive science in undergrad at Vassar College, taking not a single history class. But I obviously changed my mind on that later. I met my wife at Vassar; she is awesome.

After Vassar, I returned to Montana where I worked in a variety of jobs for eight years before returning to school. I was a [hooker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RhC1tESkRU), and I had a part-time horseshoeing business. I worked for nine seasons in Bob Marshall Wilderness. In that job, we occasionally had to blow up a horse that died in the backcountry so that grizzlies would not be attracted to it. Turns out a lot of labor goes into making wilderness areas work.

I love academics, but it's just part of my life.
