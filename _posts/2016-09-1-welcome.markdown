### Thanks for visiting!

You can read about the basic purpose of this site [here](/about/), and I give an overview of my research [here](/projects/).

I won't rehash that stuff here. This post is mainly to say: Yo -- I have a life outside of academic research.

#### About me

I grew up in Missoula, Montana, the son of public school teachers. In highschool, I played on the soccer and tennis teams. I was also into punk rock and underground zines. I "sang" in [Charles Bronson Superstar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPa9DlqiOZQ) -- a mediocre hardcore band. No match for my hardcore heroes, Bad Brains.

*Not my band (a Swedish disco group) but the guy in the lower right bears an uncanny resemblance to a young me.*

After high school, I went Vassar College, where I discovered that some 18 year olds had never used a can opener in their life. I studied Cognitive Science with an emphasis in biology. I took only _one_ humanities class (Russian Literature). Not a single history class.

After Vassar, I returned to Montana where I toiled in seasonal labor for about ten years. I built log homes, packed mules, planted flowers, worked on a ranch, and was a [hooker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RhC1tESkRU). On the side, I shoed horses.

My longest running gig in this period was working for the Forest Service in the Bob Marshall Wilderness. I was a seasonal employee there for nine years. Mostly I built trails. I also sprayed a lot of weeds (using the herbicide [picloram](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ge/2014/00000007/00000001/art00008?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf)). Occasionally we had to blow up a horse that died in the backcountry so that grizzlies would not be attracted to it. Turns out a lot of labor goes into making wilderness areas work.

The time out of school was wonderful. I hiked, hunted, canoed and fished a lot. I snowshoed for 60 days and 400 miles in Ungava. I built a house. My girlfriend from Vassar tracked me down in Montana, hiked 30 miles into the Bob Marshall Wilderness to meet me, and then moved to Montana. We got married.

I loved graduate school and love academic research. But it's just part of my life, and not the most important.
