Welcome!

You can read about this site [here](/about/), and details about my research and projects [here](/projects/).

In case you'd like a more personal introduction:

I'm from Missoula, Montana. My parents were public school teachers.

I attended Hellgate High School (really). I played soccer and tennis and sang in a hardcore [punk band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPa9DlqiOZQ).

I studied cognitive science as an undergraduate at Vassar College. I didn't take a single history class. But obviously I changed my mind on that later. I met my wife at Vassar. She is awesome.

After Vassar, I returned to Montana where I worked at various jobs for eight years before returning to school. I was a [hooker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RhC1tESkRU), entered data about textbooks, built homes (including my own), and I had a part-time horseshoeing business. My main gig was working in the Bob Marshall Wilderness, which I did for nine seasons. In that job, we occasionally had to blow up a horse that died in the backcountry so that grizzlies would not be attracted to it. Turns out a lot of labor goes into making wilderness areas work.

I love academics, but it's just part of my life.
