Welcome!

You can read about this site [here](/about/), and details about my research and projects [here](/projects/).

In case you'd like a more personal introduction:

I'm from Missoula, Montana. My parents were public school teachers.

I attended Hellgate High School (yes, that was really the name). I played soccer and tennis, and I sang in a hardcore punk band. According to the _Maximum Rocknroll_ review of my band, I would "make one hell of an auctioneer." But I didn't follow that path.

At Vassar College, I studied cognitive science. I did not take a single history class. But obviously I changed my mind on that matter. I met my wife at Vassar. She is awesome.

After Vassar, I returned to Montana where I worked at various jobs for many years before returning to school. I was a [hooker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RhC1tESkRU), a [packer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packhorse) and a [farrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrier), for example. I built homes (including my own). My main gig was working in the Bob Marshall Wilderness, which I did for nine seasons. In that job, we occasionally had to blow up a horse that died in the backcountry so that grizzlies would not be attracted to it. Turns out a lot of labor goes into making wilderness areas work.

I love academics, but it's just part of my life.
