I wrote a piece for the Miller Center of Public Affairs' "First Year Project" -- a project designed to analyze and provide advice for the incoming president. My piece, part of series on "opportunity," argues the environmental health disparities limit the opportunitities of poor and marginalized groups, and thereby contribute to social inequality. Lead is particularly pernicious in terms of its affects of the life chances of individuals. There is much that a new administration can and should be do to tackle child lead poisoning.

However, given that Trump was elected (the piece was written before the election), I might have just pleaded not to eliminate to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Anyway, here is the article: "[The Environment of Opportunity](http://firstyear2017.org/blog/the-environment-of-opportunity)," _The First Year Project_, Miller Center of Public Affairs.
