excerpt: The story of a layman who helped discover the cause of the first child lead poisoning epidemic, and how his contribution was almost completely lost to history.

National attention has focused in recent months on the widespread exposure of residents of Flint, Michigan, to water supplies contaminated by lead.

That incident demonstrated the vital roles non-experts sometimes play in discovering and drawing attention to public health problems.
