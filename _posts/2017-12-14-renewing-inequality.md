excerpt: The Digital Scholarship Lab has published "<a href=https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/renewal/>Renewing Inequality</a>," a set of interactive maps, graphs, and photos about urban renewal -- a deeply problematic federal-local program that spanned from the 1940s to the 1970s. I helped conceptualize this project as a Mellon Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the DSL. Check out the blog post for links to coverage of the project.
