I'm an environmental historian, writer, and policy analyst. Thanks for visiting my (infrequently updated) personal website.

I am currently writing a book on the history of lead poisoning in Baltimore and the nation. It is based on my dissertation, which won the Council of Graduate Schools/ProQuest award for distinguished dissertation in the Humanities and Fine Arts (2016 - 2017) and the Michael B. Katz award for the best dissertation in North American urban history (2017).

I have published academic articles in the *American Journal of Public Health*, *Global Environment*, and *Environment & History*. I also have chapters in the books *Green Capitalism?: Business and the Environment in the Twentieth Century* and *Baltimore Revisited: Stories of Inequality and Resistance in a U.S. City.*

My research has been funded by the National Endowment of the Humanities, the Institute for New Economic Thinking at Harvard, and the Mellon Foundation, among other places.

I have also contributed to or led analyses of federal environmental policy, with a special focus on the workings of the Environmental Protection Agency.

I've published op-ed and analysis pieces based on my research in the *Washington Post, The Guardian, The Hill,* and *The Conversation*, among other places. I've been interviewed or cited by Congress, *The Christian Science Monitor, High Country News, The Hill,* and the *Smithsonian*, among other places.

For fun, as well as analysis and scholarship, I created Enviro-History.com, a public, educational website that explores the environment and history through maps, visualizations, essays, music, art and other media.

Anyway -- you can read more about my research in my C.V. if you're interested.
